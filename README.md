# Solidity
As you know, Solidity is the main programming language for writing smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain.
It is a contract-oriented language, which means that smart contracts are responsible for storing all of the programming logic that transacts with the blockchain.
It's a high-level programming language that looks a lot like JavaScript, Python, and C++.
It's designed to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is hosted on Ethereum Nodes that are connected to the blockchain.
It is statically typed, and supports inheritance, libraries, and more! In short, it has all the capability that you need in order build industrial strength blockchain applications.

# what we're going to do here?
We want to teach solidity in this repository.

Stay with us.
